## What You Can Do in Our DApp?

**Step #1** Influencer/Brand Sign-up. 
Influencer/Brand signs up for dapp using social login for Web2-to-Web3 Onboarding.

**Step #2** Matching Algorithm. 
CollabY matches influencers and brands based on specific criteria, giving both control in choosing the right partner for collaborations. 

> Brands can post collaboration tasks with requirements for influencers,
> like the number of subscribers. Influencers can send their proposals
> for collaboration to be approved by brands.

**Step #3** Decentralized Collaboration. 
Once they reach a mutual agreement, CollabY's decentralized journey begins. 

> This means that the brand has approved the influencer’s application
> and started a collaboration by depositing the amount to the
> corresponding smart contract as escrow.

**Step #4** Proof of Collaboration. 
Our DApp seamlessly handles the Proof of Collaboration process, providing both sides with tools for proof of their partnership.

**Step #5** Escrow Payment. 
Payment takes place in an escrow manner, with the brand depositing funds into a smart contract for successful completion of the collaboration. Influencers are then paid shortly after providing proof of completion.

**Step #6** SBT Badge. 
CollabY's magic doesn't end there: Influencers receive an SBT badge, signifying a successful collaboration with the brand.
