**Project overview**

The Web3 creator economy lacks a consolidated platform for effective collaboration between influencers and brands. CollabY seeks to address this issue by offering a decentralized solution that connects influencers and brands while simplifying payment processes. Powered by blockchain technology, our platform ensures secure and efficient transactions, fostering a vibrant community of influencers.

Wagmi: For managing influencer payouts and rewards.

React: For building our DApp's user interface.

Tailwind: For styling and layout of our DApp's user interface.

Firebase: For storing and retrieving data in the cloud.

## What You Can Do in Our DApp?

**Step #1** Influencer/Brand Sign-up. 
Influencer/Brand signs up for dapp using social login for Web2-to-Web3 Onboarding.

**Step #2** Matching Algorithm. 
CollabY matches influencers and brands based on specific criteria, giving both control in choosing the right partner for collaborations. 

> Brands can post collaboration tasks with requirements for influencers,
> like the number of subscribers. Influencers can send their proposals
> for collaboration to be approved by brands.

**Step #3** Decentralized Collaboration. 
Once they reach a mutual agreement, CollabY's decentralized journey begins. 

> This means that the brand has approved the influencerâ€™s application
> and started a collaboration by depositing the amount to the
> corresponding smart contract as escrow.

**Step #4** Proof of Collaboration. 
Our DApp seamlessly handles the Proof of Collaboration process, providing both sides with tools for proof of their partnership.

**Step #5** Escrow Payment. 
Payment takes place in an escrow manner, with the brand depositing funds into a smart contract for successful completion of the collaboration. Influencers are then paid shortly after providing proof of completion.

**Step #6** SBT Badge. 
CollabY's magic doesn't end there: Influencers receive an SBT badge, signifying a successful collaboration with the brand.

> **How do we incorporate Particle Network's solution?**  We utilize Particle Network's solution for Web2-to-Web3 Onboarding in our DApp,
> specifically leveraging social login. This allows us to address the
> challenge faced by new crypto users, as they can easily authorize
> their social media accounts or create a crypto wallet with just one
> click on a single web page.
> 
> **What are our future plans?**  We intend to enhance our verification process and develop business analytics by leveraging Particle
> Network's data indexing feature, enabling us to integrate data from
> Web2 social media platforms. This will further improve our
